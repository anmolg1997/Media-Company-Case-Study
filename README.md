# Media-Company-Case-Study

Problem Statement:
A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show. Initially, the show got a good response, but then witnessed a decline in viewership. The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

Approach:
We are concerned about determining the driver variable for show viewership. This is the case of pridiction rather than projection where we are more interested in predicting the key driver variables and their impact rather than forcasting the results.

First we will list down the potential reasons for the decline in viewershp.

The potential reasons could be:

Decline in the number of people coming to the platform
Fewer people watching the video
A Decrease in marketing spend?
Competitive shows, e.g. cricket/ IPL
Special holidays
Twist in the story

Data:
We have been given data for the period of 1 March 2017 to 19 May 2017.
